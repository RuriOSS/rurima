# Warning:
Since rurima has not released v1.0, some usage/features may change in the future.      
# Undocumented part:
The `run` and `netns` subcommand is WIP, it should not be used by users.    
# Image source:
rurima currently supports both lxc-mirror and dockerhub as container image source.      
# Unified image puller:
rurima has a unified `pull` subcommand that can pull images easily.    
## Basic usage:
```sh
# pull alpine:edge to ./test:
rurima pull alpine:edge ./test
# pull hello-world to ./hello:
rurima pull hello-world ./hello
```
it's a bit like cmdline of docker, but, it will try lxc-mirror first if it found that the image is available there.    
## Full options:
```
Usage: rurima pull <options> [image]:[version] [savedir]
Options:
  -h, --help: Show help message.
  -m, --mirror: Mirror URL.
  -a, --arch: Architecture.
  -d, --docker: Only search dockerhub for image.
  -f, --fallback: Fallback mode, only for docker image.
```
All options should be used when you really need.     
## Examples:
```sh
# pull alpine:edge to ./test, but using dockerhub as source:
rurima pull --docker alpine:edge ./test

# pull hello-world to ./hello, but pull amd64 with fallback mode:
rurima pull --arch amd64 --fallback hello-world ./hello

# pull alpine:edge to ./test from bfsu lxc mirror:
rurima pull --mirror mirrors.bfsu.edu.cn/lxc-images alpine:edge ./test
```
# Utility commands:
## Backup and restore
```sh
# backup container at ./alpine to ./alpine.tar:
rurima backup -d ./alpine -f ./alpine.tar

# restore alpine.tar to ./alpine:
rurima restore -f ./alpine.tar -d ./alpine
```
## Other utility commands:
```sh
# update rurima:
rurima ota

# check for dependencies:
rurima dep
```
# Call built-in ruri:
ruri is a lightweight container runtime, it can be called directly by:
```sh
# Show ruri version info
rurima r -v

# Run container at ./alpine:
rurima r ./alpine
```
# docker subcommand:
The docker subcommand is an unofficial tool to get docker image from dockerhub.      
## Full usage:

  search: Search images from DockerHub.
  tag:    Search tags from DockerHub.
  pull:   Pull image from DockerHub.

You can add your perfered mirrors for `-T` option to try them first, for example: `-T hub.xdark.top -T dockerpull.org`
```
